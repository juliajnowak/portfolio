	<div class="description"> <span style="font-size: 50px">Hello!</span> My name is <span class="scale">Julia Nowak</span> and I am currently a rising senior at <span class="scale">Rutgers University</span> - New Brunswick</div>
	<div class="description-2">I am on track to graduate with a <span class="scale">BFA in Design</span> and a minor in psychology. Over the years, I have become interested in <span class="scale">UI/UX, Product Design, Web Design, and Branding</span>. My Psychology minor aids my design choices by helping me grasp how the mind of potential consumers work. With design all around us, psychology also inspired me to learn how to communicate visually and have my work speak for itself.</div><div class="description-3">I am skilled in the Adobe Creative Suite programs ranging from <span class="scale">InDesign</span>, Illustrator, to AfterEffects. To create various web design and implement UI/UX, I have also learned languages like <span class="scale">HTML/CSS,</span><span class="scale">Javascript,</span> and worked with programs like p5.js and Glitch. Additionally, with an interest in user-friendliness,
	I have created applications in <span class="scale">Figma</span> that gave me skills in <span class="scale">wireframing</span> and <span class="scale">prototyping</span>. I have also gained insightful <span class="scale">real-world experience</span> while building the brand of a business I have cofounded and marketing it to investors and professionals.</div><div class="description-4">When I'm not designing, I absolutely love to hike, listen to <span class="scale">music</span> (especially Coldplay), take <span class="scale">photos</span>, and dabble in visual forms of art from time to time! </div>
	<div class="description-2"><div class="logo-icons">For examples of recent client work, a copy of my PDF Portfolio, or other inquiries, please contact me at <span class="scale">juliajnowak@gmail.com</span>!</div></div>
